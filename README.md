# Napi101

## Introduction
The N-API is a new and better way for creating native module for NodeJS.
In this repository I tiried to create some simple and functional example of N-API.
N-API is in early stage so it may have inconsistent documentation so I create example
based on thing that I can do correctly.

## Issues
1. [N-API Callback Return](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/13562)

## Installation
```sh
npm install
# have fun with your native module.
node --napi-modules index.js
```
